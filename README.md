Stellar Price Checker Alexa

Alexa Skill to check the price of Stellar Lumens

Overview
--------------------------
Project that's based off [Amazon's sample projects](https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-java) so that you can ask for the likes of
"Alexa, ask Stellar Price for the price of a lumen" and get back the current price of a Stellar lumen. Part of the [Stellar Build Challenge](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/build/) as a proof of concept - in the future it could be a lot more flexible and allow you to specify what currency the price is given back in, how many x amount of lumens are worth and so on.
